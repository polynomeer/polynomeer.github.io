### ACL Best Practices

접근제어 대상의 종류는 menu, action, object, context로 메뉴 선택 권한에서부터 CRUD 제어, 버튼 하나하나에 대한 접근제어, 그리고 같은 버튼이나 페이지에서도 문맥에 따라 제어를 달리 적용할 수도 있다.

### Jira Components vs Label

컴포넌트는 지라 이슈를 보다 관리가능한 기능적 묶음으로 나누고자 할 때 컴포넌트를 생성한다. 컴포넌트는 프로젝트 내에서 팀, 모듈, 기능, 서브프로젝트 별 그룹핑을 할 때 사용할 수 있는 개념이다.

레이블은 부가적인 조직의 전략이다. 어떤 사용자라도 지라 이슈를 분류하거나 카테고리를 생성하고자 할 때 레이블에 키워드를 생성할 수 있다. 레이블은 컴포넌트와는 다르게 프로젝트로부터 독립적인 개념이다.

> Component:
>
> Jira issues are divided up into more manageable functional portions by Jira Components, which are divisions of a Jira project. Jira gains structure from components since they make it simple to partition a project into teams, modules, functionalities, and subprojects.
Project and Jira administrators develop components in Jira at the project level. Issues can be categorized and allocated to one or more components.
Jira Components can be used in software development, for instance, to describe elements of an app like "security," "database," "UI," or "API." However, several marketing channels like "Website," "Videos," "Partner," or "Blog" can also be employed simply. As a result, Jira Components provide advanced structure options for a wide range of project kinds.
> 
> Label:
>
> Using Jira Labels is an additional organizational strategy. Using keywords that any user can provide in a Jira issue's free text box, they are used to classify and categories Jira issues. However, this is only effective if the issue's related text field is turned on. Spaces cannot be entered in the text field.
Jira Labels are independent of projects, as opposed to Components. Accordingly, a Label made for a development project may equally be applied to a marketing effort. What first appears to be a pure advantage may actually be a drawback. Because if done this manner, labels from other projects can inadvertently be chosen and have a different meaning.
When to use Labels versus Components in Jira relies on the needs and working methods unique to your firm in each scenario.
>
> Labels can be used worldwide, while Components work better for grouping within projects. Consistency and user friendliness are ensured when an admin sets the component. Additionally, it makes sure that the team consistently groups the tasks that make up a project.
>
> Jira Labels' adaptability and uniqueness are advantageous for personal reporting, but they are also a drawback. This is because inserting a Label's name has a significant chance of resulting in a typing error, making Labels less trustworthy than Components in this situation.
>
> Therefore, labels are only partially useful at the project level, but they are an enormous added value for individual users.
