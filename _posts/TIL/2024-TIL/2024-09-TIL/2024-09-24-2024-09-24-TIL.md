### Java Proxy

> Proxy provides static methods for creating dynamic proxy classes and instances, and it is also the superclass of all dynamic proxy classes created by those methods.

To create a proxy for some interface Foo:
```java
     InvocationHandler handler = new MyInvocationHandler(...);
     Class<?> proxyClass = Proxy.getProxyClass(Foo.class.getClassLoader(), Foo.class);
     Foo f = (Foo) proxyClass.getConstructor(InvocationHandler.class).
                     newInstance(handler);
```
or more simply:
```java
     Foo f = (Foo) Proxy.newProxyInstance(Foo.class.getClassLoader(),
                                          new Class<?>[] { Foo.class },
                                          handler);
 ```

> A **_dynamic proxy_** class (simply referred to as a proxy class below) is a class that implements a list of interfaces specified **at runtime** when the class is created, with behavior as described below. A **_proxy interface_** is such an interface that is implemented by a proxy class. A proxy instance is an instance of a proxy class. Each proxy instance has an associated invocation handler object, which implements the interface InvocationHandler. A method invocation on a proxy instance through one of its proxy interfaces will be dispatched to the invoke method of the instance's invocation handler, passing the proxy instance, a `java.lang.reflect.Method` object identifying the method that was invoked, and an array of type Object containing the arguments. The invocation handler processes the encoded method invocation as appropriate and the result that it returns will be returned as the result of the method invocation on the proxy instance.
