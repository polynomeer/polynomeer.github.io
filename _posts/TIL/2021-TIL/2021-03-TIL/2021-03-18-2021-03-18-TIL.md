Protected commits
-----------------

These are your protected commits, and so their contents will NOT be altered:

 * commit 5803b18a (protected by 'HEAD') - contains 1 dirty file :
	- TIL/2021-TIL/2021-03-TIL/2021-03-15-TIL.md (2.5 KB)

WARNING: The dirty content above may be removed from other commits, but as
the *protected* commits still use it, it will STILL exist in your repository.

Details of protected dirty content have been recorded here :

/Users/ham/Desktop/untitled folder/test/polynomeer.github.io.git.bfg-report/2021-03-18/17-21-28/protected-dirt/

If you *really* want this content gone, make a manual commit that removes it,
and then run the BFG on a fresh copy of your repo.
